# FSClientCache
This is the code repo for the file system client-side cache paper titled 'Improving In-Memory File System Reading Performance by Fine-Grained User-Space Cache Mechanisms'.

This project is built on the famous open source big data storage system [Alluxio](https://github.com/Alluxio/alluxio). We have added the client-side cache related feature into that. 

The detailed setup and running methods are the same as Alluxio, you can refer to [Alluxio Documentations](https://docs.alluxio.io/os/user/stable/en/Overview.html).
